# Arena-Sounds-Fix-fivem
Thought I'd make a standalone script to help out people wth the Arena Sounds this is a server script which will disable the Cheering sound when you go by the arena so there will no longer be a annoying cheering sound thanks to this link here for helping me find a resolve https://forum.cfx.re/t/arena-sound-problem/4925601
It is a simple Drag and Drop install just make sure you ensure the script in your server config 

ensure disable_arena_cheer or start disable_arena_cheer
